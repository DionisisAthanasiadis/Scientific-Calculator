# WEB Scientific-Calculator
This project is a fully functional scientific calculator developed as part of my college degree. The calculator is designed to handle a variety of mathematical operations and functions, making it a versatile tool for both basic arithmetic and advanced calculations. Also when you view a file PW and click on the "View raw" button, it allows you to download the file directly, you can see my presentation.
